📦 Installation

1.Clone the repository: https://github.com/indrakumarcse/A-3D-ROOM
2.Make sure you have the following assets in your project directory:

-->FBX/GLTF models: Replace the existing sofa.fbx, fan.fbx, and character.fbx files in the code with your own 3D models. Ensure your models are compatible with FBX or GLTF/GLB formats.
-->Textures: Replace the existing textures for walls and floors with your own texture files (e.g., .jpg, .png). Make sure the paths in the code point to these new textures.

3.Open index.html in your browser to see the magic happen! ✨
